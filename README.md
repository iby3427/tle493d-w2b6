# tle493d-w2b6

"TLI493D_SerialPrint_stucked" file is the code I got from the Korea infineon engineer.
this file was actually for TLI series, not a TLE.
however engineer said that both of it has almost same structure, so just with a little correction, it will work well with TLE series.
Thankfully, this code works well with TLE A0 chip, but not with A1 and other chips
